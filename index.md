These maps are essential for showcasing the historical and current extent of tribal territories and are useful for tribal governments, researchers, government agencies, and organizations working with or on behalf of indigenous communities. They provide valuable information regarding the jurisdictional and territorial boundaries of different tribal groups within a specific region or area.
